# Raspberry Pi Monitor  
This node based web server can be used to serve up video and metrics from sensors attatched to GPIO sensors over http.  

## Features  
Currently only streams video (assumes the onboard camera is installed and enabled).  

## Install/Configure  
This app will be configurable via a script, file, or env variables (once we have some stuff to configure).  

For now:  
* Install - `npm install -g rpi-monitor`  
* Run - `rpi-monitor`
